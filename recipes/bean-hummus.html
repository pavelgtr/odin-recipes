        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>3 cloves crushed garlic</li>

        <li>1/4 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <li>Trim ends from zucchini and cut into quarters. Trim out seeds if zucchini are really big. Cut into 1 ½-inch pieces and add to a bowl. Toss thoroughly with 2 tablespoons kosher salt and let sit for 15 to 20 minutes, tossing halfway through.</li>
    <li>Transfer zucchini to a strainer and rinse off salt very thoroughly. Let drain well before transferring to a bowl.</li>
    <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with foil.</li>
    <li>Toss zucchini with 2 tablespoons olive oil, toss, and spread out in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet, making sure zucchini pieces touch each other.</li>
    <li>Broil on high heat until zucchini start to brown and are lightly charred, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove pan and turn zucchini pieces over. Return and broil until zucchini are tender but not mushy, and nicely browned, 5 to 6 minutes longer.</li>
    <li>Transfer zucchini to a strainer and let drain until cooled to room temperature, about 45 minutes.</li>
    <li>Combine drained zucchini, remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, tahini, garlic, lemon juice, basil, ½ teaspoon salt, cumin, black pepper, and cayenne in a blender. Blend until smooth, and taste for seasoning. You can also use an immersion blender.</li>
    <li>Wrap and chill before serving.</li>
